# weather-app
* A service that recommends clothing to wear based on the weather forecast at your location. Makes use of the Darksky API (https://darksky.net/dev/) to gather weather forecast data.
* In order for the application to work effectively, you need to make use of CORS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing" to enable cross-origin resource sharing.
* Downloading 'Allow-Control-Allow-Origin' off Chrome Store is a plug-in that works. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi
* Make sure to disable it after use, as other websites DON'T work while it's switched on.
