# weather-app
* A service that recommends clothing to wear based on the weather forecast at your location. Makes use of the Darksky API (https://darksky.net/dev/) to gather weather forecast data.

<b>Important info to run the app</b>

* <b>In order for the application to work effectively, you need to make use of CORS</b> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing to enable cross-origin resource sharing: (help below)

* <b>Downloading 'Allow-Control-Allow-Origin'</b> off Chrome Store is a plug-in that works. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi

* Make sure to disable it after use, as other websites DON'T work while it's switched on.

<b>About the app:</b>

* The app gathers the users location automatically based on latitude and longitude.

* information shown is based on the users current location.

* I also made use of another API http://ipinfo.io to gather users' current location information (latitude and longitude).
